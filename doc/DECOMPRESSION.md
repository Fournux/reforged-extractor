# Guild Wars DAT Decompression and Texture Payloads

This document defines DAT-layer compression and the ATEX, ATTX, and DDS texture payload formats. Archive addressing and MFT fields are defined in [the container format](GWDAT_FORMAT.md).

## 1. DAT compression codes

The MFT entry's `compression` field determines the first payload-decoding stage.

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | The stored bytes are the resource payload. |
| `8` | The stored bytes use the Guild Wars DAT compression format. |

Texture compression, when present, is a second stage inside the decoded resource payload.

## 2. Guild Wars DAT compression

Compression code `8` is a custom Huffman Deflate-family LZ77 format. It is not an RFC 1951, zlib, or gzip stream.

The compressed payload has these framing rules:

1. Its size is a multiple of four bytes and is at least 12 bytes.
2. It is interpreted as little-endian `u32` words.
3. The first two words seed the word-oriented bitstream state.
4. The final word is the exact decoded size in bytes.
5. Decoding ends when the declared number of output bytes has been produced.

The final size word is framing only; it never participates in the compressed bitstream. Any word-alignment padding required by the encoder precedes that trailer. A decoder that needs more bits after exhausting the preceding words must reject the payload as truncated rather than reading the size word or supplying implicit zero bits.

The literal/length alphabet contains byte literals `0x00..0xff` and 29 length symbols `0x100..0x11c`. The distance alphabet contains 30 symbols `0..29`. Other length or distance symbols are reserved and invalid.

Each block carries Huffman symbol counts and code-length runs. Format-specific fixed tables decode those runs into the block's literal/length and distance trees. Literal symbols emit one byte. Length/distance symbols copy bytes from already-decoded output; overlapping source and destination ranges use normal LZ77 forward-copy semantics. A distance cannot precede the beginning of the decoded output, and a copy cannot exceed the declared output size.

Code-length runs must cover the declared symbol count without overrunning it. Canonical codes must fit their declared bit width and reference a declared symbol. Unassigned fast-table prefixes, missing long-code helpers, and incomplete long-symbol tables are malformed input rather than implicit symbol zero.

## 3. ATEX and ATTX

ATEX and ATTX wrap DXT/BC block data. Their encoded image range is word-oriented and begins with:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x00` | 4 bytes | Container magic `ATEX` or `ATTX`. |
| `0x04` | 4 bytes | Texture FourCC. |
| `0x08` | `u16` | Width. |
| `0x0a` | `u16` | Height. |
| `0x0c` | `u32` | Data-range size. |
| `0x10` | `u32` | ATEX subcode bitfield. |
| `0x14` | bytes | ATEX bitstream and planar tail. |

Width and height are nonzero. The encoded data range ends at:

```text
0x0c + data_range_size
```

The supported FourCC families and their final block decoders are:

| ATEX FourCC | Block decoder | Bytes per 4x4 block |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `DXT1` | DXT1 / BC1 | 8 |
| `DXT2`, `DXT3`, `DXTN` | DXT3 / BC2 | 16 |
| `DXT4`, `DXT5`, `DXTL` | DXT5 / BC3 | 16 |
| `DXTA` | DXT5-alpha / BC4, exported as opaque greyscale | 8 |

`DXTL` uses the DXT5-family path with premultiplied color channels. `DXTA` has no color plane: its single interpolated channel is copied to RGB and exported with opaque alpha. DXTA decompression emits exactly its two alpha words per block; it does not reserve color-word padding. An `ATTX` MFT payload can contain non-word trailing container bytes after the encoded image; only the declared image data and complete tail words participate in decoding.

## 4. Planar ATEX layout

ATEX stores undecoded block components in planes rather than complete DXT blocks:

```text
alpha words for undecoded blocks
color-endpoint words for undecoded blocks
color-index words for undecoded blocks
```

For alpha-bearing color formats, each completed 16-byte block contains two alpha words, one color-endpoint word, and one color-index word. A DXT1 block contains one color-endpoint word and one color-index word. A DXTA block contains only two alpha words.

A subcode bitfield of `0` means that no subcode fills blocks. The remaining payload is still planar and is interleaved by the same rules.

## 5. ATEX subcodes

The field at `0x10` is a bitfield:

| Bit | Format family | Effect |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x1` | `DXT1` | Subcode 2 fills constant DXT1 blocks. |
| `0x2` | `DXT2`, `DXT3`, `DXTN` | Subcode 3 fills DXT3-family alpha blocks. |
| `0x4` | `DXT4`, `DXT5`, `DXTA`, `DXTL` | Subcode 4 fills DXT5-family alpha blocks. |
| `0x8` | Formats with a color plane | Subcode 5 fills color endpoint/index blocks. |
| `0x10` | 256×256 DXT3-family textures | Subcodes 1 and 7 reserve and unswizzle the two outer block rows and columns. |

The subcodes mark the block components they fill. Planar tail words fill the unmarked alpha and color components. The completed interleaved blocks are then decoded with the family mapping above.

## 6. DDS

A direct DDS payload begins with `DDS` and uses the standard 124-byte DDS header. Pixel data begins at offset `128`.

The required header fields are:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x00` | 4 bytes | Magic `DDS`. |
| `0x04` | `u32` | Header size: `124`. |
| `0x0c` | `u32` | Height; nonzero. |
| `0x10` | `u32` | Width; nonzero. |
| `0x50` | `u32` | Pixel-format flags. |
| `0x54` | 4 bytes | Pixel-format FourCC. |
| `0x58` | `u32` | RGB bit count. |
| `0x5c` | `u32` | Red mask. |
| `0x60` | `u32` | Green mask. |
| `0x64` | `u32` | Blue mask. |
| `0x68` | `u32` | Alpha mask. |

FourCC values `DXT1`, `DXT3`, and `DXT5` use the corresponding block decoders. A zero FourCC with the RGB pixel-format flag (`0x40`) uses the declared channel masks; the confirmed uncompressed bit depths are 16 through 32 bits. The observed two-channel 16-bit bump-map form uses flag `0x80000` and masks `0x00ff` / `0xff00`.
